Automated invoicing application that streamlines billing workflows and reduces manual processing time. Features intelligent backup systems to ensure compliance with financial record-keeping requirements.
Please use the given sample for the input and back up files. Also it is important to have a look at the README.md file.

The invoicing app was inspired  after performing a series of invoicing tasks in different companies: some require pages with backup while others do not. This app can be adjusted to every need.
Processing invoices through this custom Python application reduces manual processing time by 3-5 hours per week depending on the complexity and amount of invoicing to be done.
